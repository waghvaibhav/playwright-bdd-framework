//To jump from a step in your `.feature` file (like `Given`, `When`, `Then`) to its step definition in VS Code, you need the right extensions and setup:

### 1. **Install Cucumber (Gherkin) Extensions**
- **Cucumber (Gherkin) Full Support**  
  [VS Code Marketplace Link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alexkrechik.cucumberautocomplete)
- **Cucumber Step Definitions**  
  [VS Code Marketplace Link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stevejpurves.cucumber)

These extensions provide:
- Syntax highlighting for `.feature` files
- Step definition navigation (Ctrl+Click or F12 on a step)

---

### 2. **Project Setup**
- Make sure your step definitions are in `.ts` or `.js` files and follow the Cucumber pattern, e.g.:
  ```typescript
  import { Given, When, Then } from '@cucumber/cucumber';

  Given('I am on the login page', async function () {
    // implementation
  });
  ```

---

### 3. **How to Use**
- Open your `.feature` file.
- Hold `Ctrl` (or `Cmd` on Mac) and click on a step (e.g., `Given I am on the login page`).
- VS Code should jump to the corresponding step definition.

---

### 4. **If Navigation Doesn't Work**
- Make sure your step definitions match the step text in the feature file.
- Sometimes you need to reload VS Code or re-index the project after installing the extension.

---

**Summary:**  
Install the "Cucumber (Gherkin) Full Support" extension, ensure your step definitions are correctly written, and use Ctrl+Click to navigate from feature steps to their definitions.
